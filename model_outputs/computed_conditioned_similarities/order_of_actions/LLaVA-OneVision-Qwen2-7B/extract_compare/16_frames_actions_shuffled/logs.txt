You are an AI designed to extract actions from videos. 

Analyze the visual content of this video and list the key actions shown, 
in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.

You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Stand up, explain', 'Lay down on machine', 'Perform leg press', 'Continue demonstration', 'Demonstrate exercise']
Video B: ['Adjust machine', 'Sit down', 'Start exercise', 'Lift legs', 'Continue lifting', 'Lower legs', 'End exercise']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

You are an AI designed to extract actions from videos. 

Analyze the visual content of this video and list the key actions shown, 
in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.

You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Close-up of riders racing', 'Riders maintain positions during race', 'Riders race on dirt track', 'Riders finish lap, some fall', 'Riders navigate turns on track', 'Riders in blue and yellow uniforms compete']
Video B: ['Riders race on dirt track', 'Close-up of riders competing', 'Riders navigate turns and straightaways', 'Riders pass each other in tight spaces', 'Rider overtakes another rider', 'Rider leads the race', 'Rider falls off bike', 'Rider stands up after fall', 'Rider walks away from bike']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Mark measurements on whiteboard', 'Adjust machine', 'Continue working on machine', 'Use caliper to measure']
Video B: ['Measure laptop', 'Write on paper', 'Adjust laptop position', 'Continue writing']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

Video A: ['Ball is passed between players', 'Player attempts a shot on goal', 'Goalkeeper makes a save', 'Players position themselves on the field']
Video B: ['Players gather near goal', 'Player in orange kicks ball', 'Players react to goal', 'Smoke fills the air', 'Players disperse']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Walk towards camera', 'Hold baton', 'Stand up and walk', 'Hold baton and gesture', 'Squat on track']
Video B: ['Run on track', 'Crowd reaction', 'Athlete in red uniform', 'Athlete in black uniform', 'Crowd cheering', 'View of empty stadium']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Perform handstand', 'Jump onto foam blocks', 'Start running', 'Perform handstand on trampoline', 'Run towards trampoline', 'Stand up', 'Jump off trampoline']
Video B: ['Stand side by side', 'Move hands in front', 'Adjust stance', 'Turn to face each other', 'Demonstrate round-off back handspring tuck', 'Perform round-off back handspring tuck', 'Watch and wait for demonstration']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

2025-07-10 19:37:26,272 - INFO - System Prompt for Comparison:
You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Mix with spoon', 'Add olive oil', 'Mix ingredients in bowl', 'Knead dough', 'Add 1/2 tsp salt', 'Pour yeast mixture']
Video B: ['Add ingredients to bowl', 'Mix ingredients in bowl', 'Stand in kitchen', 'Reach for bowl']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.
