You are an AI designed to extract actions from videos. 

Analyze the visual content of this video and list the key actions shown, 
in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.

['["Add ingredients to bowl", "Mix ingredients in bowl", "Stand in kitchen", "Reach for bowl"]']
2025-07-07 17:30:05,584 - INFO - System Prompt for Comparison:
You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Add 1/2 tsp salt', 'Mix ingredients in bowl', 'Pour yeast mixture', 'Add olive oil', 'Mix with spoon', 'Knead dough']
Video B: ['Add ingredients to bowl', 'Mix ingredients in bowl', 'Stand in kitchen', 'Reach for bowl']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.
