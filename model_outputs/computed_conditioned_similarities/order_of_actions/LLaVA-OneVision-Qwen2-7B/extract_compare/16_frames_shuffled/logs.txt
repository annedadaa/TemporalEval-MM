Video A: ['Lying on side', 'Supporting body with one hand', 'Engaging core muscles', 'Strengthening abdominal muscles', 'Maintaining balance', 'Exercising under supervision']
Video B: ['Lie down', 'Perform abdominal exercises', 'Repeat abdominal exercises']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.
