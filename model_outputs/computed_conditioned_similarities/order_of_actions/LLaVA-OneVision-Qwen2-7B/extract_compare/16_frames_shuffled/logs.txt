2025-07-16 10:49:07,140 - INFO - System Prompt for Extraction:
You are an AI designed to extract actions from videos. 

Analyze the visual content of this video and list the key actions shown, 
in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.
2025-07-16 10:49:11,824 - INFO - Video Caption 1:
['["Lay down on bench", "Raise legs", "Hold position", "Lower legs", "Repeat exercise"]']
2025-07-16 10:49:11,824 - INFO - Video Caption 2:
['["Adjust leg press machine", "Perform leg press exercise", "Stand up from machine", "Walk away from machine"]']
2025-07-16 10:49:11,824 - INFO - System Prompt for Comparison:
You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Lay down on bench', 'Raise legs', 'Hold position', 'Lower legs', 'Repeat exercise']
Video B: ['Adjust leg press machine', 'Perform leg press exercise', 'Stand up from machine', 'Walk away from machine']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.
