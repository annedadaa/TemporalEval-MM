You are an AI designed to extract actions from videos. 

Analyze the visual content of this video and list the key actions shown, 
in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.

2025-08-03 11:29:04,506 - INFO - System Prompt for Comparison:
You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Position legs on machine', 'Lie back on bench', 'Push legs forward and return', 'Adjust equipment settings', 'Continue leg press exercise']
Video B: ['Approach exercise machine', 'Sit on the machine', 'Adjust machine settings', 'Lie back and perform hip raises']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Hiking uphill', 'Navigating rocky terrain', 'Scenic mountain backdrop']
Video B: ['Walk towards water', 'Start running towards camera', 'Run past the camera']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Flatten dough', 'Roll dough', 'Shape dough into triangle', 'Roll dough again for desired shape']
Video B: ['Fold dough', 'Press edges', 'Fold dough again', 'Press edges', 'Final fold', 'Press edges']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Stir pot', 'Turn off appliance', 'Stir again', 'Stir again']
Video B: ['Add finely chopped pecans', 'Stir']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

Based on the provided frames, it appears to be a static scene from a robotics competition, likely taken through a control module or operator's perspective. There is significant camera stabilization and minimal movement. Given this, there are no dynamic actions to extract as all key elements remain static.

Key actions observed (if any dynamic actions occur):

- ["Initial setup or starting position"]

Since no dynamic actions are visible, the list above captures initial observation without further detailed action extraction.

Video B: ['Players line up for play', 'Quarterback hands off the ball', 'Player runs with the ball', 'Player is tackled', 'Ball is recovered by the defending team', 'Players regroup, referee signals', 'Player recovers the ball']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.
