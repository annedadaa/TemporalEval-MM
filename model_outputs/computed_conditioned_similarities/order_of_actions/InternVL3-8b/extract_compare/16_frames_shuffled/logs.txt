To come up with a list of key actions from the video, consider the repetitive and significant movements performed by the person throughout the clips. Each action step should be descriptive and concise.

1. **Start Plank Position**: The initial movement involves assuming a starting plank position, which is a foundational body alignment necessary for the upcoming yoga poses.
2. **Move to Handstand**: Transitioning to a handstand, balancing with the head, knees, and heels positioned on the floor while the hands support the body.
3. **Adjust Leg Position**: Adjusting the leg position on the stool, lifting and balancing the leg towards the ceiling while maintaining the headstand.
4. **Maintain Balance**: Holding a balanced handstand position with one leg extended toward the ceiling and the other resting on the stool.
5. **Release and Reset**: Lowering the leg from the stool to the floor and returning to the plank position, preparing to start again.

These actions reflect the sequential physical exercises and transitions demonstrated in the video.

To capture the key actions displayed in the video within a Python-style list, let's break down the movements observed throughout:

1. **Lie on back**: Participants frequently lie on their backs, which indicates a starting or resting position for many exercises.
2. **Perform leg movement**: Throughout various frames, there is a consistent action of lifting and maneuvering the legs.
3. **Reach forward**: Several students are observed reaching their hands forward while in a prone position, which could indicate stretching or balancing exercises.
4. **Adjust posture**: Small adjustments to the body position are visible, indicating dynamic engagement and focus on form.

These actions collectively represent the core activities captured in this video, highlighting the repetitive and focused nature of the exercises being performed.

Here's the list of key actions:

You are an AI designed to extract actions from videos. 

Analyze the visual content of this video and list the key actions shown, 
in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.

["Address ball", "Swing", "Hit golf ball"]
2025-08-05 17:31:43,892 - INFO - System Prompt for Comparison:
You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Batsman prepares to face', 'Bowler bowls', 'Batsman hits the ball', 'Fielder catches the ball', 'Umpire signals out']
Video B: ['Address ball', 'Swing', 'Hit golf ball']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.
