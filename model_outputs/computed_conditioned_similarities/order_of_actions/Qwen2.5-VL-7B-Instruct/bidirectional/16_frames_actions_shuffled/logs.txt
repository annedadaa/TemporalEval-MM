2025-07-10 15:29:31,983 - INFO - System Prompt for Extraction:
You are an AI designed to extract actions from videos. 

Analyze the visual content of this video and list the key actions shown, 
in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.

You are an AI designed for video understanding and action alignment.

The input is a list of key actions extracted from a video:
['Lower legs', 'Extend legs', 'Repeat', 'Lie on leg press machine']

Now, watch the provided video and determine how well it matches the reference sequence in terms of their order of actions.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.
