You are an AI designed to extract actions from videos. 

Analyze the visual content of this video and list the key actions shown, 
in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Lie on leg press machine', 'Extend legs', 'Lower legs', 'Repeat']
Video B: ['Lie on machine', 'Lift legs', 'Lower legs', 'Repeat exercise']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Adjust trailer wheel', 'Look around']
Video B: ['Crouch next to trailer', 'Point at trailer features', 'Person walks past']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

You are an AI designed to compare ordered action sequences.

The input consists of the two sequences of actions extracted from two videos respectively.

Video A: ['Start climbing', 'Ascend rocky slope', 'Reach summit']
Video B: ['Climb mountain', 'Navigate rocky terrain', 'Ascend steep incline', 'Reach summit']

Your task is to evaluate how similar the two action sequences are in terms of their order.
Output a single similarity score between 1 and 5, where 1 means completely different and 5 means extremely similar.
Do not explain your reasoning. Only output the numerical score.

in the order they happen.

Respond with a Python-style list of short verb-based actions.
For example: ["Enter room", "Sit down", "Pick up phone"]

Keep the list as short and informative as possible — 3 to 6 key steps are enough.
